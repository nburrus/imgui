#  TODO
 

- Plot widget that allows zooming, etc. While still having a good auto-scaling
    - Ensure  a good aspect ratio too
- More features on the image window: show color behind cursor, zoom in.
- Add support for string / int values   
- Test custom OpenGL callback, e.g. to draw a line on top of the image

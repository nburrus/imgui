#  TODO
 
- Automatic layout buttons
    - Honor the preferred size
- Automatic layout for new windows
- API to set window properties
- Plot widget that allows zooming, etc. While still having a good auto-scaling
    - Ensure  a good aspect ratio too
- Cheap check for caller code to know if a window is visible. Could use a boolean address.

#  TODO
 
- Presets for the layouts
- Plot widget that allows zooming, etc. While still having a good auto-scaling
    - Ensure  a good aspect ratio too
- Cheap check for caller code to know if a window is visible. Could use a boolean address.
- Remove padding to the image windows.
- More features on the image window: show color behind cursor, zoom in.
- Add support for string / int values
